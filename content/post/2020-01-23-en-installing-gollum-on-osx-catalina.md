I‚Äôm working on a wiki page on Gitlab. In this particular case, I need to attach a file into the wiki. Which can‚Äôt be done using web editor on Gitlab. So I‚Äôm trying to edit it locally. In short, I need to pull the wiki and install Gollum on my laptop. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt go smoothly like a banana (?).

The worst part is this
{{< image classes="fancybox center clear fig-100" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*R5mLq4A8VptfTlbIEhSL7g.png" title="Installation failed due to missing header" >}}

After some research, this error caused by missing C headers on my OS. In OSX 10.15 (Catalina), the Xcode path is renewed. And also apparently Apple stopped shipping (some of) the C header files for Ruby and split them in a separate package. Looking for answers, I‚Äôm trying a couple of methods:
1. Switch the Xcode to CommandLineTools and switch back to App (https://github.com/castwide/vscode-solargraph/issues/78#issuecomment-552675511). It doesn‚Äôt work
2. Find the headers package on `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages` folder. But it does not exist on Catalina. It doesn't work.
3. Export the **CPATH** to `export CPATH="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include‚Äù` and add it to your shell profile to make it persists (https://stackoverflow.com/a/57949803/2763662). IT WORKS! üéâ

**TL;DR;**

If you‚Äôre running OSX Catalina and got the missing header error message, you should try exporting CPATH variable to the Xcode headers package path.
